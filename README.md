# Keyboardio Model 01 Firmware

My personal Model 01 firmware configuration.

## Plugins Used

* MouseKeys
* LEDControl
* NumPad
* LEDEffect-Rainbow
* LED-Stalker
* Qukeys

## Special Keys

"Special keys" are keys with modifiers applied to them. For instance: `LCTRL(Key_Spacebar)`. Below is a list of such keys, plus an explanation. All are intended for a (specific) Mac.

### `KEY_EMDASH`

A simple shortcut to produce an em-dash on a Mac.

### `KEY_LAUNCHBAR`

A simple shortcut to invoke LaunchBar via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Space, on my system).

### `KEY_DEL_LINE`

A simple shortcut to delete the contents of the line left of the cursor. Also deletes selected files, items, etc. that respond to Cmd+Delete.

### `KEY_1PASSWORD`

A simple shortcut to invoke 1Password Mini (Cmd+\ on my system.).

## Notes

Some of the plugins are arguably removable, namely NumPad, MouseKeys, and LED-Stalker.

Qukeys is currently used for only a single key (tap Alt for Enter, or hold for Alt). A simpler solution, such as a macro, might be better.
